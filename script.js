// when we click start, timer will start and question 1 will appear
// question 1 will have 4 choices, either you get the answer right or wrong
//              what happens when wrong?
//                      you deduct from the timer
//                      log in their score as 1 wrong (maybe might not need to do this)
//                      then we move onto the next question
//              what heppens whenr ight?
//                  log in their score as 1 right
//                  move onto the next quesiton
//once timer or questions are taken up, we will set the page to game over and have their score listed onto the page
//we ask user to input initials and we save up in the local storage where user can access their score at a later time on the top left of the page

//might need to add a 'go back' function when looking at scores
